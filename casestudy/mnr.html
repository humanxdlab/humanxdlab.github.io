                <h6>PROBLEM</h6>
                <p>
                    I was hired to improve the User Experience as well as redesign the User Interface of their event page. The event page was a descriptive long page about the particular running event with a link to directly register on their website. A user would typically search the event and then click on a event to get to the event page. 80% of their user would interact with the event page on regular basis. However, the users would not register on the event page rather directly go to the event website. There was a heavy churn rate. 
<br><br>
A user research was done by the team to understand the decline. Data presented showed that most of the users felt that the information presented was confusing and not easy to navigate (as shown in the picture below). This is mostly the case when the information architecture is broken. All the information were laid down as a scrollable long list without a logical flow, categorisation or proper labelling.<br>
                <br>
                   The team did realise it before but choose to put all the information in a single page to keep navigation to minimum and reducing the complexity of the UI. 
                    <br>
                    
                </p>
                <br>

                <hr class="section-divider">
                <br>
                <br>

 <h6>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h6>
           <br> <br>     I decided to use card sorting to understand how best the information could be laid down and to find out logical categorisations. Specifically,  Open Card Sort since we were unsure about the categories.

                <h6>DESIGN</h6>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I asked the team to participate in the activity and to get 5 users to be participant.  I used trello for the card sorting sessions since I was based remotely. I created individual boards for each participant and sent them a link with all the instructions. by copying the first template board. 



We found a natural pattern when matched all the participants. This was how the design was inspired.
 <br>
                    <br>
To make the interaction fluid and interactive without having to change any backend data model, it was important that a lot of information are still in the same page. Also, this would make navigation easier without having to go out of the main context. Therefore, during the User Interface design a lot of emphasis was given on icons, images, colors to add visual cues in a subtle way for easy navigation. 
</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
               
                
For instance the page had the route map that opens a new window which according to the user research done before showed pop-ups are annoying and there is performance problem when you interact with a pop-up.

                <h6>USER INTERVIEWS</h6>
                <p>
                    Based on the personas, we mapped out different possible customer journeys. We did this in Trello.
                    <br>
                    <br> WeTrack built a loyal customer base with their customer centric product who often gives feedback in their product roadmap. They pulled in some of the big names as listed previously such as Expo2020 Dubai, ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 etc.
                    <br>
                    <br> I managed to interview few of their word of mouth users to understand how they generally add a new software to their workflow.
                    <br>
                    <br> Findings from the interviews: Usually hear about a new software through Google (such as 10 best event management app articles); get a lot of recommendation from their network. <br><br> At the later stage, the user interactions helped me in creating the customer journey.
</p>

                <br>

                <p>We did a detailed design session of each sketch of the customer journey such as landing page, sign ups, pricing etc. along with high-level contents.
 <br><br><img src="./assets/we-review-requirement.jpg"  class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></p>
                    <br><br>

 After gathering all of this information, I created wireframes with touchpoints on various persona to see how each persona would interact with the journey. These wireframes were critically discussed with the team with quick iterations and then evaluated with users. </p>

            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">



   <p>In the next step, I took time to know the WeTrack branding (Colours, Logo, Fonts, product screenshots etc. ) and tone of voice, I did mock-ups of  the wireframes.</p>

   <p>I did a user evaluation based on 3 tasks with their word of mouth users to test the mockup.</p>

   <p>Finally I worked on hi-fidelity mockups (UI) including responsive design. Specifications for developers with proper asset and copy through invision, as well as SEO optimisation tips image size, keywords, content etc…
