            <h3>User-Centered // Data-Driven // Agile // Inclusive</h3> What is UX for me? User experience design is about designing a coherent flow of user intention that facilitates the highest degree of satisfaction with least resistance to the process. The improvement of the performance of this flow is an iterative learning process based on data-driven from the user‚Äôs needs, user‚Äôs action, the tools where the action is performed and the context.
