<i>Notes:
<br>
Over the years, UX as a discipline has evolved from simple usability checks to policy changes that had improved services; to ordinary labelling fixes that impacted millions. This has also transformed my understanding about UX.
<br> <br>
Today, I see UX as an ever-evolving system of coherent intentions that touches people's lives in many tangible and intangible ways to provide at least a satisficing influence.


</i>
</p>
<!-- What is UX for me? User experience design is about designing a coherent flow of user intention that facilitates the highest degree of satisfaction with least resistance to the process. The improvement of the performance of this flow is an iterative learning process based on data-driven from the user’s needs, user’s action, the tools where the action is performed and the context.

I first came across the term User Experience in 2011 while doing a design project for ABB at the Aalto Design Factory. Since, then I've learned, practiced, taught, eliminated and reused many ways to approach building an experience. 
<br><br>
After tweaking, failing, experimenting and going through many learnings I settled in this following principles that I use to approach any design work.
</p>
<h3>User-Centered // Data-Driven // Agile // Inclusive // Evolving // Natural </h3>
                <br>

While no two design challenges are same, there is an underlying structure (design process) I follow to keep me focused, resilient, creative and humble. It continues to evolve based on my own academic and professional experience + working and learning from UX thoughtleaders such as Prof. Yuvvone Rogers, Kia, Don, Jacob,; 
<br><br>
Learning from fellow colleagues and attending UX design conferences. in continuous update with latest design patterns and trends is definitely a challenge,
<br><br>
   While it is not a strict rule nor every project is not big enough to encompass the over-arching UX design process but I do follow it closely.

                    I begin by understanding the project brief that could be a series of emails to stakeholder workshops. The idea is to gather as much information about the following from the stakeholders:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Context: Understanding the problem/design challenge/intend</li>
                        <li>User: Who are the users involved/affected</li>
                        <li>Opportunity: Understand the (business/brand) goal, objectives & proposition</li>
                        <li>Practicalities: Scope of the project, resources available, expectations and stakeholders involved. Current research done? Past analytics?</li>
                        <li>Other bits: Engagement with the team, resources in place, communication with the internal and external stakeholders.</li>
                    </ul>    </p>
