Frame the challenge

         What are we setting out to design, and why? The toughest questions are best asked early on.

Start at the end

With a clear idea of our intent, we‚Äôll quickly move into creative thinking and design exploration. Early sketches and design ideas allow you and your customers to give feedback and direction. 


Sprint to greatness

Design and front-end sprints will have user testing built in, so we check our work and thinking as we progress. However your company develops software, we can plan a design approach which balances the need for speed with the goal of first-class user experience.
 



Mature the experience
Once the new experience is live, data and customer feedback allow you to tune and improve every aspect.


DESIGN SPRINT
Understand: Discover the business opportunity, the audience, the competition, the value proposition, and define metrics of success.
Diverge: Explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility.
Converge: Identify ideas that fit the next product cycle and explore them in further detail through storyboarding.
Prototype: Design and prepare prototype(s) that can be tested with people.
Test: Conduct 1:1 user testing with 5-6 people from the product's primary target audience.





          We know how to engage stakeholders right across your business so that they feel invested in what you are trying to build. 
DESIGN STRATEGY

Lay out the track
Setting out to build the new customer experience means making trade-offs and priority calls. We bring you the evidence you need to make good decisions in planning.
          Clarify the purpose and intent that will guide design. Create a plan to make it happen.

 <h6>MY ETHOS</h6>
           <br> <br> My UX process is data-driven and inclusive in terms of being , 


User experience design is about designing a coherent flow of user intention that facilitates the highest degree of satisfaction with least resistance to the process. The improvement of the performance of this flow is an iterative learning process based on data-driven from the user‚Äôs needs, user‚Äôs action, the tools where the action is performed and the context.

                <p>I asked the team to participate in the activity and to get 5 users to be participant.  I used trello for the card sorting sessions since I was based remotely. I created individual boards for each participant and sent them a link with all the instructions. by copying the first template board. 



We found a natural pattern when matched all the participants. This was how the design was inspired.
 <br>
                    <br>
To make the interaction fluid and interactive without having to change any backend data model, it was important that a lot of information are still in the same page. Also, this would make navigation easier without having to go out of the main context. Therefore, during the User Interface design a lot of emphasis was given on icons, images, colors to add visual cues in a subtle way for easy navigation. 
</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
               
                
For instance the page had the route map that opens a new window which according to the user research done before showed pop-ups are annoying and there is performance problem when you interact with a pop-up.
