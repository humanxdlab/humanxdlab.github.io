                <p><i>Notes:
<br>
I first came across the term User Experience in 2011 while working on a large design project for ABB in Finland. 
<br> <br>
Over the years, UX as a discipline has evolved from Norman's principles to policy changes that had transformed services; to ordinary labelling fixes that impacted millions. This has also transformed my understanding about UX.
<br> <br>
Today, I see UX as an ever-evolving system of coherent intentions that touches people's lives in many tangible and intangible ways to provide at least a satisficing influence.
<br> <br>
<!-- Since, then I've learned, practised, taught, eliminated and reused many ways to approach building an experience.  -->
And after tweaking, failing, experimenting and going through many learnings I settled in these following principles that I use to approach any design work.
<br> <br>
<i><span style="font-weight:700;">User-Centered // Data-Driven // Agile // Inclusive // Empathy // Organic </i></span>
            
</i>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <!-- What is UX for me? User experience design is about designing a coherent flow of user intention that facilitates the highest degree of satisfaction with least resistance to the process. The improvement of the performance of this flow is an iterative learning process based on data-driven from the user’s needs, user’s action, the tools where the action is performed and the context.
 -->

                    <p>
                        While no two design challenges are the same nor approaching it in the same way would provide us the best results. However, there is an underlying structure that I follow to keep me focused, resilient, creative and humble. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It’s based on my own academic and professional experience, working and learning from design thoughtleaders such as Yuvvone Rogers, Don Norman, Jacob Nilsen, Kristina Höök, Ben Shneiderman etc.. The main highlights are drawn upon from concepts such as JTBD (Job To Be Done), lean and agile methodologies, asking the right questions, identifying user pain points and contextual investigation.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Although the nature of the design process is presented in a sequential manner, it is iterative and there is a level of flexibility to align the process based on the suitability of the project. 
                    <!--     While it is not a strict rule nor every project is not big enough to encompass the over-arching UX design process but I do follow it closely. -->

                    <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Understanding the context (intend)</i></span>
                        <br> I begin by gaining insights of the business vision, goal and objectives of the brand. I use a variant of the lean canvas to gather the key information including the problem/challenge and customer segment (user). </p>

                        <br> I use a petal diagram or a 2X2 Matrix to identify the direct and indirect competitions. This provides us insights on where the brand sits, customers reaction to them, preparation for customer interaction and potentially this kind of comparative analysis provides innovative ideas during the ideation stage.</p>
                    <br>

                            <br>
                        The above steps provides us with hypothesis to be tested and helps us define the intial success metrics. This ensures all stakeholders are aligned with key aims and expectations before moving into the design stage.</p>

                    <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Practicalities and limitations</i></span>
                        <br> Finally before moving to the research phase, it is important that I am made aware of any deadlines, upcoming launch, any communication protocols with stakeholders, organisational structure etc.

                    <h6>RESEARCH</h6>

                     <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Any previous research</i></span>
                        <br> I try to find out if there is any previous (formative/summative) research work being conducted (market/user research, competitor analyses, etc.) and analytics data (incase of an existing product) as this would help in adding to the hypothesis. 
                    </p>
                    

                    <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Interacting with the users</i></span>
                        <br> Initial research will help to test the assumptions. Interacting with users gives me insights on their day to day life, their needs and pain points. I do this by running qualitative studies such as interviews, ethnographic studies, observations, survey, guerilla testing etc. 
                    </p>
                    <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Expert evaluation</i></span>
                        <br> Incase a proof of concept/MVP is already being built, I would run expert evaluation technqiues such as cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, tree testing to create awareness of the designs, content and flow.</p>

                        <br> The research provides solutions to the hypothesis. Such as if we are targeting the right user. User persona and empathy map are created based on the profiles identified creating user empathy.

                        <br> If the analytics are in place for an existing product, I go through them to find trends and patterns and to understand the user funnel. This could be fed back into the following journey map</p>

                    <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Mapping the data</i></span>
                        <br> Creating user journey and service blueprint helps visualise the mental model in a multi-dimensional way and shows the different touchpoints critical to the user job to be completed.

                        <br> By the process of diverging and converging we explore, develop and iterate creative ways of solving the problem, regardless of feasibility. We do this by design workshops, brainstorming sessions, google sprint. Resolve conflicting design ideas amongst project stakeholders.</p>
                    <p><i><span style="font-weight:700;">Lo-fi prototyping and iteration </i></span>
                        <br> Designing low fidelity prototype(s) that can be tested allow us to get feedback. This is done by early sketches and sitemaps, mockups, user flow. Finally creating wireframes to set the overall direction and description for the prototype. Test hypothesis early and often Gather feedback on multiple designs with representative users

                    <p> Research is a significant part of designing any kind of services and product. At various stage of the design cycle, I use different techniques. With any good research it is important to lay out the hypothesis, set research questions, understand the participants, recruit the right participants, have a suitable sample size, use the appropriate data collection techniques as well as data analysis.</p>
