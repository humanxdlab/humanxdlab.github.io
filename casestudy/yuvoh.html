                <h6>ABOUT YUVOH</h6>
                   <p>Yuvoh creates a more predictable model for property investor on short term and long term yield by using machine learning techniques to analyse a variety of online, offline and hidden data sources, including real estate portals, property marketplace platforms (like RightMove and AirBnB) and government statistics. It also helps them to handholding the investor from search till the property is rented by providing additional bespoke services such as furnishing etc.</p> 

                    <hr class="section-divider">

                    <h6>PROBLEM</h6>
                    <p> Property investment market is broken, traditional companies like zoopla, rightmove are focused on residential property while do not fully cater for buy to let. Rise of airbnb, booking.com have gave rise to a increase short let market with higher rental yield. Short term let and long term let have different rental yields and investors go to property educators, look for market trends through various source, some guestimates and some does detailed analysis over excel. This cost them time, money, market uncertainity and often not the right deal</p>

                    <h6>AIM</h6> 
                    A MVP (Minimum Viable Product) gained popularity among property investors (network of early adopters) due to its yield estimation engine but it had challenges around user Experience, engagement and product-market fit. The MVP was a basic web application without a coherent branding, UI or any responsive mobile site. 

                    


                    <h6>REQUIREMENT GATHERING</h6>

                    <p>I started by running stakeholder workshops to gather requirements and familiarise myself with the work. And to develop an understanding of the business goals and objectives, user needs, roadmap, constraints and technical feasibility. This meant together we had an entire picture of the user and the vision they had for the platform.
                        <br> With their sales, marketing, data scientist, engineers and product manager from across the business, we mapped out key stages in the customer journey and how the business currently addressed the needs of customers. This provided a set of hypotheses to explore with the user interviews.
                        <br> For understanding the business, I used a hybrid canvas that addresses (Goal, Objective, Problem, Solution, Customer segment, Value proposition, Competitor Analysis, Team) I began the project by interviewing MEC‚Äôs product stakeholders and editorial team to understand their requirements.

                    </p>

                    <h6>User Research</h6>
                    <p>We began by interviewing a number of property investors, from first-timers to experienced investors. Interviews were done over Skype. This gave us insights about how people discussed investment, gathered information from property educators and shared with investment buddies.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Key Findings</h6>
                    <p>We drew on these insights all the way through the design process. We identified features that would help customers understand their choices and make more informed, confident purchase decisions. Our research highlighted which elements were unique to different groups of property investors and that there are 3 main personas.
                    </p>
                    <p>Persona: Based on the interviews/stakeholder workshop we set up three personas. We referred to them throughout the entire product development process. </p>

                    <p>Expert Evaluation of the existing journey: I also conducted a detailed review of the existing platform‚Äôs content structure, core features and user journeys.
                    </p><img src="./assets/yuvoh-evaluation.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

                    <p>The interviews helped us piece together the process that is undergone when a new client is signed on. We found there were dips inefficiency caused by non-automated systems, use of multiple tools between departments, and inability to track a client once they've been onboarded. For example, the distinction between the need for rich visuals and 360¬∫ viewability when making a decision to purchase a bike opposed to the specific discoverable information and the comparative size of vehicles required by car buyers. User insight helped set the design direction quickly and show this in a Proof of Concept. This meant that before significant investment in development we could check and improve our thinking with feedback from business stakeholders and target customers.</p>

                    <h6>Creating wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes for user testing
</h6>
                    <p>We quickly moved into the product design phase. Sketching wireframes allowed us to quickly test design solutions to customer problems. We noticed that distinguishing how big a vehicle is in relation to another vehicle was an important early factor in understanding the Suzuki range. These kinds of differentiating insights across user groups occurred throughout our design research process and fed into our visual design direction for each product line.
                        <br>
                        <br> I worked with LearningMate‚Äôs design team in a series of 2-week sprints to define the key features of the new platform.
                        <br>
                        <br> We tried out a range of ideas as lo-fi sketches and then developed them into mid-fi wireframes in Invision Freehand. These wireframes were tested and iterated multiple times with the early adopters.

                    <h6>DESIGN SYSTEM</h6>

                    <p>The complex nature of the app necessitated more than 70 screens covering user on-boarding, Wi-fi setup, support and power user features like port forwarding.
                        <br>
                        <br> To maintain consistency and ensure efficient design to dev handover, I developed a modular design system based on reusable components and their states, such as cards, list items, and controls. Every component can be rearranged and combined with others while maintaining design consistency and recognizable UI patterns for the user.</p>
