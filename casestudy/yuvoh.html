                    <p>I was the lead UX designer on this project working with senior stakeholders from Microsoft, Kent County Council, Good care group alongside Department of Computer Science and Brain Sciences at UCL who were responsible for building a prototype.</p>

                        <h6>REQUIREMENT GATHERING</h6>


                        <p>I started by running stakeholder workshops to gather requirements and familiarise myself with the work. And to develop an understanding of the business goals and objectives, user needs, roadmap, constraints and technical feasibility. This meant together we had an entire picture of the user and the vision they had for the platform. <br>
                        With their sales, marketing, data scientist, engineers and product manager from across the business, we mapped out key stages in the customer journey and how the business currently addressed the needs of customers. This provided a set of hypotheses to explore with the user interviews.<br>
                        For understanding the business, I used a hybrid canvas that addresses (Goal, Objective, Problem, Solution, Customer segment, Value proposition, Competitor Analysis, Team)
                        </p>


<p>Persona:
Based on the interviews/stakeholder workshop we set up three personas. We referred to them throughout the entire product development process. </p>

                        <h6>DESIGN SYSTEM</h6>


                        <p>The complex nature of the app necessitated more than 70 screens covering user on-boarding, Wi-fi setup, support and power user features like port forwarding. <br><br>
                        
                        To maintain consistency and ensure efficient design to dev handover, I developed a modular design system based on reusable components and their states, such as cards, list items, and controls. Every component can be rearranged and combined with others while maintaining design consistency and recognizable UI patterns for the user.</p>
