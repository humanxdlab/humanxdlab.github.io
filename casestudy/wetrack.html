            <h6>PROBLEM</h6>

            <p class="text-white">
                WeTrack completed a system redesign a year back. Analytics data revealed that they didn't had success in getting organic customers online.
                <br>
                <br> They acquire all of their customers through word of mouth who are then trained to use the software by the team. This pose a big problem when scaling the product
                <br>

            </p>

            <br>

            <h6>GOAL</h6>
            <p class="text-white"> To improve the user experience of the onboarding process and reduce the customer support time.

                <h6>REQUIREMENT GATHERING</h6>
                <br>
                <p>I hold stakeholder workshop to understand their business vision and user. The workshop was conducted remotely due to a distributed team. This made me explore new tools. </p>
                <br>
                <br>

            </div>

            </div>

            <div class="col-md-5">

                <p> To understand the business I used the business model canvas (BMC).
                    <br>
                    <br>As someone with limited knowledge on the industry, this quickly provided me with the necessary understanding about the customer segment (primary and secondary customers), the value they provide, the revenue model, the channels, customer relationships they maintain, and the competitors landscape.

                <br>
                <p>We then created persona and empathy map for different customer segments to understand the users and build empathy towards them.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>Based on the personas, we mapped out different possible customer journeys in Trello (Remote friendly tool) to gain insights on the critical touchpoints </p>

                <h6>USER INTERVIEWS</h6>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    <br> WeTrack built a loyal customer base with their customer centric product who often gives feedback in their product roadmap.
                    <br>
                    <br> I interviewed and surveyed few users to understand their journey, pain points, experience with Wetrack and how they generally add a new software to their workflow,.
                    <br>
                    <br> On 80% of them usually heard about a new software through Google while some relied on their professional network.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <h6>KEY FINDINGS + TASKS</h6>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> Based on the insights from the workshop, analytics and user research, I focused on 3 key areas as follows:
                <br>
                <br> Improving the UX of landing page and cater it for mobile users: Design a customer centric responsive website that would also reflect WeTrack’s brand through appealing visuals, clear CTA’s, concise messaging and granular analytics to measure KPIs.
                <br>
                <br> Automating the onboarding process: Design a self-explanatory onboarding process that would allow the customers to set-up free trials and explore the product without sales support.
                <br>
                <br> Managing different profiles with single login: Allow user to access and manage different profiles at once.
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <h6>KEY FINDINGS + TASKS</h6>
                <p>We did a detailed design session of each sketch of the customer journey such as landing page, sign ups, pricing etc. along with high-level contents.
                    <br>
                    <br><img src="./assets/we-review-requirement.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></p>
                <br>
                <br> After gathering all of this information, I created wireframes with touchpoints on various persona to see how each persona would interact with the journey. These wireframes were critically discussed with the team with quick iterations and then evaluated with users. </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">

                <p>In the next step, I took time to know the WeTrack branding (Colours, Logo, Fonts, product screenshots etc. ) and tone of voice, I did mock-ups of the wireframes.</p>

                <p>I did a user evaluation based on 3 tasks with their word of mouth users to test the mockup.</p>

                <p>Finally I worked on hi-fidelity mockups (UI) including responsive design. Specifications for developers with proper asset and copy through invision, as well as SEO optimisation tips image size, keywords, content etc…
